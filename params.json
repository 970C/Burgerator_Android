We are working with the app's founder, Ammar Shallal from NYC. The update will include the ability to browse the app without the need to log in, capturing location data upon opening the app, and possibly updates to the social functionality - allowing users to more easily follow other Burgerator users.\r\n\r\nThe Hamburgerlers' vision is to fulfill the expectations of our client by porting the successful IOS Burgerator app to Adriod. In this process we will perform the desired upgrades to the app to take it to the next level, Burgerator 2.0!\r\n\r\nClient: Ammar Shallal ammar@burgerator.com\r\n\r\nOur dev team is composed of CWU CS seniors:   \r\nK.
